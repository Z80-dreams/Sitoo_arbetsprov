/* 
   This is the javascript file for the index page.
   Here I fill add one class for the main page, and functions
   to handle popups, tables, buttons etc. 
   I don't want to use classes for these sub-elements, as I 
   want the main page-class to handle the state of the app. 
   The other components should be state-less. 
   I will also try to write code for immutable date, and then only change 
   the data through the API.
